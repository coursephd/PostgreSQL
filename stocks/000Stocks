Efficacy of a drug or treatment method explains whether “it works”, effectiveness of a treatment explains whether “it works for population”. This is the fundamental gap between a clinical study designed and real world medical practice carried out on a day to day basis. Effectiveness of a drug could be defined as interactions between various components at play. And interactions could be defined in different contexts, first one, use of actual drug, second is patient and disease characteristics and the third one is the healthcare system related characteristics. The purpose of the effectiveness research is to assess these interactions. This covers the entire span of epidemiologic and public health research methods. Which interactions are universal, how do they distribute locally, what is magnitude of impact, what is the mechanism of action, etc. are some of the major questions to name a few through this enquiry.
Effectiveness of individual drug is of utmost importance as well as there is a need to understand comparative effectiveness when there is more than one treatment option available. Effectiveness of a drug could be under question due multiple reasons. Population using the drug may not be consistent with the population for which the drug was developed. Effectiveness could be affected by lack of adherence to the intended schedule of usage or intended practice. These situations could misrepresent the data and a perceived gap between efficacy and effectiveness could emerge.
Methodological options for an integrated efficacy and effectiveness evidence generation plan should be explored.
